### Filter 

Filtering allows the administrator to set up a particular query returning only the desired information. Filters can be saved for ease use at any time. 

![UI_describe](/media/01_00_03_11_UI.png)

For example the IT department might want to see only the hosts with a state of DOWN, indicating some sort of issue. 

A query returning that information is as follows:

```
[hosts] state = 1
```
Queries can be built using internal creator in the form of expandable lists and AND/OR conditions. Please keep in mind that contents of the lists change based on the primary category that was chosen. 

## Host configuration menu 

In the configuration menu of the host, in the top right side end of the screen, several buttons are located:

![UI_describe](/media/01_00_03_05_UI.png)
>
1. License
    - shows what OS your mainframe is running on, version of Energy Monitor alongside the details of your license, when it expires and how many hosts you can afford to monitor.   

2. Configuration Page
    - Shortcut to "**Manage**" -> "**Configure**"

3. Save 
    - Leads to submenu allowing to check what saves are pending to be written into the database.

4. Undo
    - In case of mistakes, undo restores the state of the database by 1 save back. So if you make a mistake, save and undo, the database will be restored without errors. But If you saved once more after 1st save, only the latest mistakes will be undone.  

5. Changelog
    - shows all already saved changes into the database.

Below them, another set of buttons is located:

1. Object type allows an expandable list of shortcuts to various aspects of the system configuration, reducing the amount of steps and clicks to change windows.

2. Below are self explanatory shortcuts to different features, which change depending on what is currently chosen in "**Object Type**"

The last set of buttons governs the following features:

![UI_describe](/media/01_00_03_09_UI.png)

````
1. Dependencies 
    - This setting allows to set up Parent-Child relation between 2 hosts, resulting in notifications being sent from the child host if the parent host experiences some sort of malfunction.

2. Escalations

    - This setting allows to overwrite the default contact policy for the host, if it remains unresponsive for the set amount of time. After that time, escalations send their own pre-defined notifications to contacts and groups. Ie. If a host doesn't respond for 5 minutes, Group A is informed. If after 10 minutes problem isn't resolved, host escalates and both Group A and Group B is informed.

3. Advanced 
    - Shows full possible parameters that can be set on a host/service

4. Clone
    - Create 1:1 copy/copies of the selected host/hosts. One can define a number of hosts meant to be created. 

5. Copy 
    - Allows to create a 1:1 single copy of the selected host.

6. Propagate
    - Allows to set up chosen parameters on multiple hosts without having to edit manually each one. 

7. Delete 
    - Deletes the host from the database.
