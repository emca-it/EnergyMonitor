# Notification Log 

Energy Monitor allows convenient way to visualize notification history. 

Enter "**Report**" -> "**Notifications**" -> "**All Notifications**" 

Those are the same application logs that can be found under: **/opt/naemon/var/log/naemon/naemon.log** which is the default directory as specified in **/opt/naemon/etc/naemon/naemon/naemon.cfg**

If the need arises, the list can have a custom filter applied, by clicking the icon of a "**funnel**" and specifying the parameters.
